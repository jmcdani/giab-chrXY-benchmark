The chrXY Benchmark v1.0 README was generated YYYY-MM-DD by Jennifer McDaniel, NIST.

GENERAL INFORMATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Title of Dataset
HG002 Chromosome X and Y benchmark

### Background
Benchmark developed from T2T HG002 complete assembly of chromosomes X and Y.  This benchmark
includes more challenging regions, like segmental duplications, that were excluded 
from previous GIAB benchmarks.
